# RMIT Software Engineer Process and Tool Notes

> This is the summary of all the notes for Software Engineer Process and Tool contains all of the essential stuff for you to pass the exam

!> The note is missing **User Stories and backlogs** and **Version control, Git, Gitflow.** Any helps on contributing these notes would be appreciated.

## Features
1. Search
2. Quick Notes `Note icon`- with formatting
3. [RSVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation) read `Glass Icon` (fast reading) - the feature is experimenting, sometimes does not work well.
4. [Sans Forgetica](https://sansforgetica.rmit/) read `Font Icon` (for better remembering)
5. Offline mode - experimenting
6. Responsiveness on any devices.
   
## How to use it correctly?
1. Skim through the notes first with either RSVP or normal reading. - Sometimes it's easier to just read normally because of the formatting.
2. For better remembering, use Sans Forgetica by hovering to the note and select the `Font Icon`
3. After remembered, click on the Note Icon to type what you remembered. If you can type the note without looking, then you have mostly remembered it :-). 
4. Remember to self-test the previous reading sometimes.


## Todo
Notes left to complete:
- [x] Week 9
- [x] Week 10
- [x] ~~Week 11 (not examinable)~~
- [x] Answer for Week 12
