# Requirement Engineering

?> Requirement engineering process is <mark>the process of establishing the services that the customer requires from a system</mark> and <mark>the constraints</mark> under which it operates and is developed.

?> The requirements are the <mark>descriptions of the system services and constraints that are generated</mark> during the requirements engineering process.

**List of the requirement:**

- Functional and non-functional requirements 
- The software requirements document
- Specification requirements
- Requirements engineering process

**What is a requirement**

Statement of a service or of a system constraint

## Types of requirement

1.  **User requirements**
   - Statement/diagram in <u>natural language</u> of the **system’s functions**
   - In Agile it’s referred as *User Stories*

2. **System requirements**
   - A structured document with **detailed descriptions of system’s functions.**, services and operational **constraints**. 
3. **Non-functioanl requirements**
   - A constraint of operation of the system. Not what it does but **HOW** it does.
   - Example: efficiency, reliability, security, learnability,…

## Non-functional classifications

1. **Product requirements**
   - Requirements which specify that **the deliver product must behave in a particular way**
2. **Organisational requirements**
   - Requirements **regarding to organisational policies and procedures**
   - E.g: process standards used, implementation requirements, etc.

3. **External requirements**
   - Requirements which are external to the system and its development process
   - E.g: law stuff…

## Goals and requirements

!> Non-functional requirements may be very difficult to state precisely and imprecise requirements may be difficult to verify.

**Goal**: 

- A general intention of user: easy to use

**Verifiable non-functional requirement**:

- A statement using some measure that **can be objectively tested.**

>  Goals are helpful to developers as they can convey the intentions of the user.
